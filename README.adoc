= gtfstidy docker image

Just builds a docker image for https://github.com/patrickbr/gtfstidy[gtfstidy] (regularly every few months, and on changes on this repo).

Uses the original repo (thus no code here) and the Dockerfile from this repo. Builds mostly on work from https://github.com/leonardehrenfried/gtfstidy.

    docker pull ghcr.io/geosci-gmbh/gtfstidy-docker:latest

[NOTE]
====
This repo will be removed/archived when the original repo has a docker image (see https://github.com/patrickbr/gtfstidy/pull/23).
